To make code more clear and proper I propose Strategy pattern.
To do this new interface is needed. We need to create 5 separate class such as:
-AddItems(...)
-DeleteItem
-GetAllItems
-GetItemById
-UpdateItem
Based on that we dont need LocationsRepository and TeamsRepository classes.
LocationsController and TemsController will works as a context.
